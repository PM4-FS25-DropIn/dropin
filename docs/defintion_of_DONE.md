## Our Definition of Done:

1. Unit tests pass and coverage met standard (85% or above)
2. Sufficient negative unit tests were written (more or less the same amount negative
than positive)
3. Code is reviewed via a PR approved by at least one other member
4. Clean Code Standards are met
5. Continuous integration implemented -> also continuous deployment in backend
